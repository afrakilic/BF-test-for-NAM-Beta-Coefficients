## Bayes Factor Hypothesis Testing for Network Autocorrelation Beta Coefficients

This simulation study presents Bayes factor testing for β coefficients in the network autocorrelation model using Savage-Dickey ratio and BIC approximation methods. It proposes Bayes factors for two-sided and multiple hypotheses testing procedures


In network autocorrelation model, the classical hypothesis testing
procedures for independent variables’ effect on the outcome variable can
only be used to falsify a precise null hypothesis of no effect. Classical
methods are incompetent for both quantifying evidence for the null and
testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously. In order to deal with these
limitations, this study presents Bayes factor testing for β coefficients in
the network autocorrelation model using Savage-Dickey ratio and BIC
approximation methods. We propose Bayes factors for two-sided and
multiple hypotheses testing procedures. Simulation results suggest that
Bayes factor for the latter shows higher performance and it is the one we
recommend. Then, we illustrate the practical use of the proposed Bayes
factors with two real data examples and compare the results to those
coming from classical tests using p values. Finally, R code used in this
study and for computing the proposed Bayes factors is provided.
